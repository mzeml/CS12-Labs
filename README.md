# CS12-Labs
The lab work from my second CS course. This was a much harder course than CS10 was. Looking back, it seems easy, but as someone new to programming it was terrifying!

Please do not plagiarize my code. Instead, try to understand how it works so that you can formulate your own solutions. That way, you can become a better programmer.
